GpsNose.SDK.Mashup
==================

Welcome to the GpsNose integration package ;-)!

You can use the login, real geo-data and nearby anonymous communication from the GpsNose platform in your web-site.

Please, check the developer's manual with code-samples and HowTos available here:
https://wiki.gpsnose.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/GpsNose_DeveloperManual.pdf

Key-points
- Your users can enter the web-community of your website (%www.YOURDOMAIN.com) or a sub-community (%www.YOURDOMAIN.com@fishing)
- Your otherwise virtual users are immediately real geo-enabled, can communicate in real-world and real-time also outside your web.
- The data your users generate are available at your website, such as users, PoIs, events, tracks..

Important
- To use this web SDK, you must first setup a valid web-community mashup to GpsNose at the mashup-admin:

- Set the provided GnLocalSettings properties as needed in the startup code to your own values:
    GnLocalSettings.AppKey
    GnLocalSettings.Community
